# linear-regression-model


This project demonstrates the implementation of **Simple Linear Regression** using Python to understand the relationship between two variables: **Experience** and **Salary**. The goal is to predict salary based on years of experience using a linear model.

## 📌 Objectives

- Load and explore a salary dataset
- Visualize the relationship between experience and salary
- Apply Simple Linear Regression to model the data
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error and R² Score
- Visualize the regression line along with actual data

## 📂 Dataset

A small sample dataset with two columns:
- `YearsExperience`
- `Salary`

This dataset is commonly used for linear regression demonstrations.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## 📊 Key Steps

1. **Data Loading**: Imported CSV data using Pandas
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualized the dataset using scatter plots
3. **Model Building**:
   - Trained a Linear Regression model using `sklearn`
   - Split the dataset into training and test sets
4. **Prediction & Evaluation**:
   - Predicted salaries on the test set
   - Evaluated performance using MSE and R² Score
5. **Visualization**:
   - Plotted the regression line over the training data

## 📈 Sample Output

- Scatter plot showing the regression line
- Model accuracy metrics printed to assess performance

## 🚀 Future Work

- Extend to **Multiple Linear Regression**
- Add polynomial regression for non-linear relationships
- Try other real-world datasets for generalization
